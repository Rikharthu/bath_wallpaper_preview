# Wallpaper Preview

## Building and Running the Application

The application uses the [texture-synthesis](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis) Rust library and our
FFI bridge is generated using the `cbindgen`utility. As such, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
and [cbindgen](https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen) must be installed

XCode by default doesn't user the system's `PATH` variable. The easiest way to make `cargo` accessible to XCode during
the build phase is to modify the [bin/compile-library.sh](/bin/compile-library.sh) and change the line

```shell
PATH="$PATH:/Users/<user>/.cargo/bin"
```

to point to own Cargo installation directory.

Next, model weights must be downloaded
from [OneDrive/Shared Models](https://computingservices-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/rak56_bath_ac_uk/EpuBnN5Utd5PjCufX5bNYFkB7gFVWwDfyUkqJgv313QMww?e=dQr7FK)
or [Google Drive/Shared Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uxwYHxXAon9ae0vLJkPip-aGRLmRimNj?usp=sharing)
and placed into the [Wallpaper Previewer/Neural Networks](Wallpaper%20Previewer/Neural%20Networks) directory in Xcode.

From now on the project can be configured as usual Xcode iPhone application project and run on devices.
